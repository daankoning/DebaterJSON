# DebaterJSON

DebateJSON allows you to easily keep track of your performance in debating by providing a schema for the storage of this data. 

## Why DebaterJSON?

* **Analysis:** DebaterJSON provides an easy interface to perform analysis on your data so you can tell how much you're _actually_ improving.
* **Centralisation:** DebaterJSON keeps your data in one central location so you don't end up having to keep open dozens of tab links, each of which made with different tab software.
* **Persistence:** As the recent ending of the Heroku free tier sadly demonstrated, data that is not on a drive you own can disappear at any time for any reason. DebaterJSON solves this by ensuring that you will always have a permanent record of how you did. (Note that this tool is intended to store individual debater's records, if you want to archive an entire tournament, have a look at [DebateXML](https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/DebateXML).)
